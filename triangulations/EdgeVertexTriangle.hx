 * Created abstraction to make 't' cleaner to use.
 * Quote from 'findingEnclosedTriangle'
 * Indexing triangles here involves some evil hacking. 
 * A triangle is represented by an edge and a vertex of its co-edge.
 * Suppose the edge in question has number j, and k is 0 or 1 depending on which
 * co-edge vertex is chosen. Then the triangle index is t = 2 * j + k.
 *   
 * typedef and abstract used to represent j, edgeId and k, vertexId
